## Prerequisites

Before start recording steps for test case in iZiTest, ensure that you have installed the [iZiTest Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/izitest/jccdlahjcpgcoolknheeddgdpfgpniho). The extension allows you to execute a test case locally on your chrome browser and automatically generate test results.

:::note
The extension is only available for Google Chrome browser. If you use browser private mode you need to [allow the extension to work in private mode](/docs/tutorial-extras/allow-extension-private-mode.md).
