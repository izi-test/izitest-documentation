# Test configuration

The test configuration is where you define the basic information about the test case, such as Base Url, Browser resolution for recording and execution, and privacy mode.
:::info
Test configuration is extended from project configuration. You can define the project configuration in the project settings.
Once Test configuration is edited for the first time, it will be saved as a separate configuration and will not be affected by the project configuration.
