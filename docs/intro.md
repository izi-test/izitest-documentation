# Introduction

Welcome to iZiTest, your one-stop platform for creating, managing, and executing automated tests for web applications. With Izitest, you can achieve fast, reliable, and collaborative testing without the need for extensive coding knowledge.

## Effortlessly Create and Manage Tests:

🛠️ **Intuitive Project Management:** Create and manage multiple projects, each with its own base URL, description, and execution settings. Invite your team to collaborate on projects and assign roles for access control.

📝 **Simplified Test Creation:** No coding required! Craft tests using natural language-like Cucumber expressions or leverage our Chrome extension for effortless test recording. Record user interactions like clicks, inputs, selections, and more, which are automatically converted into clear and maintainable Cucumber steps.

## Powerful Features for Seamless Testing:

🔧 **Enhanced Test Control:** Modify recorded steps, change element targets, or group actions into reusable global steps for increased efficiency.

👁️ **Visual Test Verification:** View screenshots of each step or element for clear visualization of test actions. Reorder steps with drag-and-drop functionality for simplified test organization.

🔍 **Built-in Assertions:** Validate test outcomes by verifying text elements, element presence, or page URLs directly within Izitest.

## Streamlined Execution and Reporting:

🚀 **Zero Installation Required:** Execute tests directly through our Chrome extension, eliminating the need for additional software setups or driver installations.

🔄 **Parallel Test Runs:** Run multiple tests concurrently on your local machine (Test Run) to optimize testing speed.

🌐 **Remote Grid Execution:** Schedule test executions on our remote grid for seamless integration with your CI/CD pipelines.

📊 **Detailed Reports:** Generate comprehensive reports after each test execution, including information on failed steps, errors, screenshots, and videos for remote executions.

## Collaboration and Integration:

📅 **Test Plan Management:** Organize your tests into well-defined test plans for targeted execution. Schedule executions directly from the test plans for consistent testing practices.

🚀 **One-Click Test Runs:** Launch a test run for any test plan with just a click, simplifying test initiation.

🔄 **Local and Parallel Execution:** Choose between local test execution (sequential) for quick testing, or parallel execution on your local machine to save time on comprehensive testing.

📈 **Project Dashboard:** Gain valuable insights with your project dashboard. View test reports, recent user activity, execution history, and informative charts for comprehensive project oversight.

🔗 **Jira Xray Integration:** Import and export tests, test plans, and reports seamlessly between Izitest and Jira Xray for a unified testing experience.

Izitest empowers teams of all backgrounds, from business analysts and testers to developers, to achieve high-quality software through effortless automation testing.
